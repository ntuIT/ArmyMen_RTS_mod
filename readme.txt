3.  Gameplay 

From the Main Menu, you can select the following:

BOOT CAMP (TUTORIAL)
Boot Camp offers three lessons in real-time strategy basics.

GREAT BATTLES
If you're in the mood for simple short skirmishes, Great Battles allows you to choose from a list of unique single-objective missions.

CAMPAIGN GAME
Campaign mode takes you on 15 action-packed missions through the backyard and into the house in your search for the renegade soldier, Colonel Blintz.

MULTIPLAYER GAME
Now you can challenge friends to tactical battles online, either on a Local Area Network or over the Internet. Join up as teammates or play head-to-head. The goal is simple: defeat your opponent's troops and destroy his or her Headquarters.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------


BASIC STRATEGY

There are several steps you will need to follow in each and every mission.

1) Begin each mission by building a Headquarters. This allows you to build one or two Bulldozers and several Dump Trucks.

2) Use a Bulldozer to build a Resource Depot reasonably close to any resources you see, and then send your Dump Trucks to the resource to mine it.

3) When your Headquarters are built, you're ready for recruits! Use one of the Bulldozers to build a Barracks, and pump out those soldiers for an attack on the Tan. Create a basic squad comprised of Grunts, Grenadiers and a couple of Mine Sweepers. With your squad ready for action, send them out to explore the area immediately around your base.

4) Once you've sent your squads out to explore the area, you'll have a general idea of where the Tans attack from and the basic layout of the land. With these things in mind, build a Barbed Wire Fence around your camp. It's also a good idea to put a few Guard Towers between pieces of fence. The Tower functions as a lookout and has the firepower of several Grunts.

5) When you've got the resource reserves built up enough, upgrade your Headquarters to a Super Headquarters and build a Garage. Use the Garage to build Medic Trucks that can heal your troops, your buildings and each other. You can also create Machine Gun Trucks (aka: Half-Tracks), Minelayers and Tanks.

6) When you have the resources, upgrade your Barracks to Super Barracks. You can use this new structure to pump out a more specialized platoon: Bazooka Men, Machine Gunners, Snipers and
Mortar Men. 

7) Finally, when you have the resources available, upgrade the Garage to the Super Garage and make Choppers for aerial assaults on the Tan base!

NOTE: If any Building or Soldier icon in the Construction Menu appears shaded, you either don't have the necessary requirements or the resources available to build it yet.

7.   Troubleshooting

Installation Issues

Problem:   The computer freezes during install, or you receive an error message during install.

Answers:   

1. Your computer may be using an older 16-bit CD-ROM driver. 

To check if your computer is using an older 16-bit CD-ROM driver:

- Right-click on the 'My Computer' icon and select 'Properties'.
- Click on the 'Performance' tab.
- In the Performance status box, if the File System line says, "Some drivers are using MS-DOS (R) compatibility", you are using a 16-bit CD-ROM driver.  If you are using 16-bit CD-ROM drivers: Contact the manufacturer of your CD-ROM drive or the manufacturer of your computer for an updated 32-bit CD-ROM driver.

2. There may not be enough space on your hard drive for temporary files to expand and/or you need to free up resources.

To free up Resources:

- Close all unnecessary programs running in the Background. (See "Resources and Background Tasks.")
- Keep at least 100MB free on the hard drive that the game is installed to, or twice your RAM, whichever is larger.
- Delete all files in your C:\Windows\Temp folder, and then empty the Recycle Bin.

3. The CD-ROM drive might be having problems with how it buffers information. 

To turn off read-ahead on the CD-ROM drive:

- Right-click on the 'My Computer' icon and select 'Properties'.
- Click on the 'Performance' tab.
- Click on the 'File System' button.
- Choose the 'CD-ROM' tab at the top.
- Change the 'Optimize access pattern for' field to 'No read-ahead'.
- Click on 'Apply', then 'OK' and finally click 'Close' (you will be prompted to restart your system).

4. The Autorun or DMA settings on your CD-ROM drive could be interfering with the game installation.

Turn off the Autorun and DMA settings on your CD-ROM drive:

- Right-click on the 'My Computer' icon and choose 'Properties'.
- Click on the 'Device Manager' tab.
- Click on the '+' sign next to the CD-ROM line so that it becomes a '-' sign.
- Click on the line that appears under the CD-ROM line to highlight it, and then click on the 'Properties' button.
- Click on the 'Settings' tab.
- Look for the Auto-insert Notification and DMA lines.  If there is a check mark in the boxes next to either of these lines, click on the box to remove the check mark.
- Click on the 'Apply' button, and then click on the 'OK' button.
- When you are asked if you want to restart your system, choose 'Yes'.
 
Problems With Running the Game:

- The game does not launch properly: If the game gives an error message, locks the system, blanks out the screen, or simply returns to the desktop with no activity when attempting to launch:  A) Resources and Background Tasks, B) Display Settings, and C) Direct X Troubleshooting below.

- During normal gameplay, the game crashes and returns to Windows or locks the system: 
 A) Resources and Background Tasks, C) Direct X Troubleshooting, and D) SOFTWARE vs. HARDWARE acceleration below.

- The game runs slow or choppy or with blurry graphics:  A) Resources and Background Tasks, C) Direct X Troubleshooting, and D) SOFTWARE vs. HARDWARE acceleration below.

- Sound skips, repeats, or is garbled:  A) Resources and Background Tasks and C) Direct X Troubleshooting below.

General Solutions:

A) Resources and Background Tasks: 

Windows may be running any number of background tasks that hog the system resources so that it cannot run your game smoothly.  Before you start the game, press the CTRL+ALT+DELETE keys at the same time to bring up the Close Program window.  End Task on all programs except Explorer and Systray, then try running the game.  If this worked and you are running Windows 98, you'll want to go to the Windows Start menu and click on Run, then type in "MSconfig" and hit Enter.  Go to the Startup tab and uncheck everything here except for System Tray.  This will disable those programs from loading when the system starts, but you can re-enable them any time by running this program again and re-checking the Startup options.

You may also want to run Scandisk and defrag utilities within Windows for basic preventive system maintenance. Consult the Windows help files for more information.

B) Display Settings: 

Many 3DO games require Windows to be set in a certain display mode in order for the game to operate. In your Display Settings (Right-click on the desktop and select "Properties" and the "Settings" tab) make sure that your Colors are set to 16-Bit High Color (maximum) and the screen area is set to 800x600 (minimum).  If you are not able to move the slider for your screen area to at least 800x600 pixels, make sure that your monitor type supports this resolution.  To do this, click on the "Advanced" button and the "Monitor" tab.  If necessary, change the monitor type to "Plug & Play Monitor" under the standard types that Windows offers. "Super VGA 800x600" should also work.  If your monitor is already identified as one of these types and you still can't move the slider, your video card may not be capable of supporting a high enough resolution.  Consult the video card's manufacturer for more information about supported display modes.

C) DirectX Troubleshooting:

DirectX: DirectX is a program incorporated into the Microsoft Windows 95/98/ME family that allows various hardware-intensive programs, particularly games, to take direct control of all the hardware components within your system.  Nearly all PC games currently on the market make use of DirectX, and Microsoft periodically updates DirectX to allow PC-based games to take advantage of new technologies.  A current version of the DirectX installer is always available at <www.microsoft.com> in the Download Center.

Device Drivers: Many of the hardware components in your computer, such as the video card and the sound card, require software programs called drivers to function properly.  Drivers contain vital information about these devices, like the instruction sets the computer uses to call on them. DirectX coordinates these drivers and manages the way that they interface with the Windows environment for running games and programs. 

How it all works: DirectX interfaces directly with the device drivers to enhance the quality of graphics and sound in multimedia programs.  To give a rough idea of how game software works, all the instructions originate from the game and are then passed to DirectX. Then, DirectX gives them to the driver software and the driver software ultimately interprets those commands for the hardware to execute the operation.  Because Microsoft periodically updates DirectX, games are usually written for the latest version available and shipped with it.  However, when you update your version of DirectX, in order for your hardware to interface with it properly, it is sometimes necessary to obtain updated drivers for your hardware. The hardware manufacturers usually provide updates as a free download. 

What to do: DirectX includes DXDIAG, a very complete and comprehensive tool for DirectX troubleshooting and settings.  To use it, follow these directions:
揃Press the 'Start' button on the Windows 95/98/ME-task bar and select 'Run'.
揃Type "dxdiag" (do not include the quotes) then click on the 'OK' button.  This will run the DirectX Diagnostics Tool.
揃To make sure all your files are DirectX compatible, select the 'DirectX Files' tab to ensure that there aren't any exclamation points next to the file names.  If you find exclamation points under this tab you will probably need to reinstall DirectX by either reinstalling the game, or visiting <www.microsoft.com> and downloading their latest version of the game installer.
揃By clicking on the Display and Sound tabs, make sure all of your drivers are DirectX compatible. Select the 'DirectX Drivers' tab and make sure there are no exclamation points next to any of the file names.  If you find exclamation points under this tab, you will need to update your drivers by contacting the manufacturer of the hardware through their phone support or through their website.  You can get more information on which version of DirectX is supported by your version of the device drivers. Contact either the original manufacturer (such as ATI, Hercules, etc.) of the component, or the maker of the entire system (such as Compaq, Dell, etc.) that uses the component.

D) SOFTWARE vs. HARDWARE acceleration

The two main methods of processing a game with 3D graphics are known as software rendering and hardware acceleration.  Software rendering places the load of the graphics functions on the system's main processor (CPU).  Because of the limitations of this mode, the graphics will display with less definition and fewer special effects such as special lighting, shadows, etc.  Hardware acceleration uses the video card's built-in processor to do the calculations for special graphics effects, and offers more capabilities for the games graphics.  Not all video cards are capable of hardware acceleration, and those that are may support more special graphic features than others.  If your game is running poorly in hardware-accelerated mode, your video card may not be able to handle all of the hardware acceleration functions the game has enabled.  If applicable, you may need to change the game's graphics settings to software acceleration.  Refer to the game manual for more information on how to change this setting within the game. 

A Note on Windows 2000:

Unless otherwise stated on the box, 3DO's games are not supported on Windows 2000 at this time. There are several reasons for this, but the main reason is that in that DirectX is not as smoothly integrated with Windows 2000 as it is in the case of Windows 95/98/ME.  As Microsoft has attested on its own website, Windows 2000 is based on the Windows NT code and is aimed mainly at powerful office and networking applications. Alternately, Windows 95/98/ME are comparatively better suited to recreational and multimedia programming.  As such, 3DO feels that its resources are better put towards developing and testing on other platforms.  We hope you will understand the logic of this decision, and we sincerely thank you for your patience and apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.  GameUpdate (TM)
GameUpdate is a program that will search the 3DO website for game updates.  You must be connected to the Internet for GameUpdate to function.
 
-Connect to the Internet
 
-Go to Start | Programs | 3DO | GameUpdate
 
-Follow the instructions when the GameUpdate window opens
 
Please note:  If a newer version of GameUpdate exists, then only the GameUpdate program may be updated.  You may need to reboot your system, reconnect to the Internet and run the new version of GameUpdate to update your 3DO game.

9.  How to Play Army Men: RTS in GameSpy Arcade

You can play Army Men: RTS online through GameSpy Arcade, which comes conveniently bundled with the game.  If you haven't done so already, insert your GAMENAME CD and install Arcade now.  Then, to play Army Men: RTS online, just follow these simple instructions:

Launch GameSpy Arcade and Go to the Army Men: RTS Room: Click on the GameSpy Arcade link in your Start Menu. When the software starts, you'll see a list of games and more along the left-hand side. There's plenty to do, but there's time for that later: Click on the Army Men: RTS button on the left to enter the GAMENAME room.

Find or Start a Army Men: RTS Server: Once you're in the Army Men: RTS room you can meet or greet other players, find servers or create your own server. The top half of the application will list all of the available servers, including the number of people playing and your connection speed (measured by something called "ping." The lower your ping, the better.) Don't like any servers? Click on the "Create Room" button to start your own server and wait for people to sign up. (A clever server name, such as "Taste the end of my rusty hob-nailed boot!" usually attracts people). Otherwise, double-click on a server of your choice to join in.

Joining and Starting a game: Once you double-click on a server or start your own, you'll be in a staging room, in which you can trash talk with your fellow players and prepare for combat.  When you're ready to play, click the "Ready" button at the top of the screen.  When everyone in the room has signaled their readiness, the host can then launch the game. Arcade will fire up Army Men: RTS and the carnage will begin!
